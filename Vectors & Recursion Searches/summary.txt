Summary
			
			1) Declare a struct to hold data in a record
			
			2) Initialize counter variables
				- for use in assigning scores to students
			
			3) Open a file for reading
				- records.txt
			
			4) Declare a pointer to an array
				- initialize it using random function
			
			5) Create a vector object
			
			6) Populate the vector using the read file
				- using push_back() template function
				- using applyScores function to assign
			
			7) Display the vector using a for loop
				- use set precision to give accurate double
				- nested for loop to display scores
			
			8) Declare a pointer to an array
				- initialize it using random id function
			
			9) Use random Ids to search the vector.
				- using binarySearch member function
				- called recursively
			
			10) Search at the end of the vector and display
			
			11) Search for an ID that is not in the record
				- function returns -1 if it cannot find
				- if -1 is returned, display proper output
